# NeuralNetAPI
A Numpy based API for creating and training of neural Networks

With this project i want get a deeper understanding how neural nets work. So i tried to programm my own API for creating and training neural nets.
With this API i can create Sequentual Models with different Layers, Activation-functions, Loss-function and Optimizerns.

For an explaination of the main functions read the guide.pdf (not online yet). For an Example how my API work look at example.ipynb

Layer:
  Dense\
  Conv2D\
  Pooling\
  BatchNorm\
  Dropout\
  Flatten\
  Reshape\
  Activation
  
Activation-functions:
  sigmoid\
  relu\
  leakyrelu\
  softplus\
  softmax\
  tanh
  
Loss-functions:\
  squared-error\
  categorical_crossentropy\
  binary_crossentropy
  
Optimizer:\
  SGD (stochastic gradient descent with momentum)\
  AdaGrad\
  RMSprop\
  Adam
